# Bounded-Functions-on-Character-Varieties

There are currently 3 main Jupyter Notebooks in this repo:

  - sigmas_general_case.ipynb

  - dragos_experiment_general.ipynb

  - dragos_experiment2_general.ipynb

## sigmas_general_case.ipynb

This notebook contatins the base code used for the other notebooks. It contains many methods that compute matrices of coeffecients using methods described in bounded_21.pdf (mainly sigma matrix). The comments contain which lemma/result they use from that document.

## dragos_experiment_general.ipynb

This notebook aims to test for specific values of <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+j" 
alt="j"> and <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+n" 
alt="n"> if the

alt="\{\sigma_{i, j} : 0 \leq i \leq j\}"> contains a polynomial of degree <img src=

alt="n"> whose leading coefficient has valuation <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+-w_q%28n%29" 
alt="-w_q(n)"> ?"

The folder dragos_data contains subfolders with data for specific $p$ uptil a maximal <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+N" 
alt="N"> . The subfolders are named "(p),(degree-of-extension),(N),(ram for totally ramified, unram for unramified)". Note all totally ramified extensions adjoin a root of the polynomial <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cdisplaystyle+x%5Ed+-+p" 
alt="x^d - p">, where <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+d" 
alt="d"> is the degree-of-extension, and so other totally ramified extensions must be inputted manually.

The run.txt file allows automatic generation (useful for leaving the program running over night for example) of multiple sets of data for different "(p),(degree-of-extension),(N),(ram for totally ramified, unram for unramified)". Add in extra lines for a specific case to be run and execute all code blocks in the notebook. Subfolders with the name "(p),(degree-of-extension),(N),(ram for totally ramified, unram for unramified)" will be generated with the data in dragos_data/. Note that if a subfolder already exists with the same name, the program will skip the case (so delete empty subfolders since these cases will be skipped if they are in run.txt).

There are 3 files in each subfolder.
- box.png
- data.txt
- dot.png

data.txt contains the raw data.

box.png is a pictorial representation of whether or not the question is true for specific values of <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+j" 
alt="j"> and <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+n" 
alt="n"> . Light blue represents "yes", dark brown represents "no" and <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cdisplaystyle+s_q%28n%29+%5Cleq+q-1" 
alt="s_q(n) \leq q-1"> and light pink represents "no" and otherwise.

dot.png shows the least <img src=

alt="s_q(n) \leq q-1"> also.

## dragos_experiment2_general.ipynb

This notebook aims to find the first polynomial for which it is in the <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+o_L" 
alt="o_L"> span of <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+%5C%7B%5Csigma_%7Bi%2C+j%7D+%3A+0+%5Cleq+i+%5Cleq+j+%5Cleq+k%5C%7D" 
alt="\{\sigma_{i, j} : 0 \leq i \leq j\ \leq k}"> of degree <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cdisplaystyle+m%2B%28q-1%29n" 
alt="m+(q-1)n"> with <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cpi" 
alt="\pi">-valuation of leading term <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cdisplaystyle+-w_q%28m%2B%28q-1%29n%29" 
alt="-w_q(m+(q-1)n)">. Denote the first <img src=
"https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Ctextstyle+k" 
alt="k"> that this is true as n0.

The data is stored in a similar manner to dragos_experiment_general.ipynb but is instead stored in dragos_data2/ and the same method of using the run.txt file allows auto-generation of data.

The plot n0.png plots the answer to the question upto a maximal N. Red crosses denote that such a polynomial in answer to the question has not been found. Blue crosses denote that it has and the value n0-n will be plotted.
